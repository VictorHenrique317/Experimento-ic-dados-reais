*** Dependencies ***

To run, pre-process (TriclusterBox) requires the Boost library. Most of GNU/Linux
distributions have it in their repositories. Simply use your package
manager to install it. Notice however that Debian and its derivatives
(including the *buntu) split that library into several packages. If
you run one of them, you must install libboost-dev,
libboost-program-options and libboost-program-options-dev.

To manually install the Boost library (for example if you are running
a proprietary operating system), this Web page may help you:

*** Compilation ***

pre-process (TriclusterBox) was meant to be built with GCC version 4.7 or later.
However one can easily adapt the makefile to use another compiler.

To install pp on a *NIX-like operating system, run (with
administrator privileges):
$ make install

If you do not have access to administrator privileges or if you do not
run a *NIX-like operating system, simply run:
$ make
The executable, called pp, is created in the working directory.
You can then move it to a personal directory listed in your PATH variable.


*** Compilation Options ***

Several options can be easily enabled (respectively disabled) in
Parameters.h by uncommenting (respectively commenting) them:

OUTPUT turns on the output. This option may be disabled to evaluate
the performance of paf independently from the writing performances of
the disk.

DEBUG turns on the output (on the standard output) of information
during the expansion of the patterns. This option may be enabled
by who wishes to understand how this expansion is performed on a
small number of closed error-tolerant n-sets.
